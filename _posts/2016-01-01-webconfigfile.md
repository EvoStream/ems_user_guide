This file contains the EvoStream Web Server (EWS) configuration. The locations of various web server files/folders can be changed here. Various web server settings such as HTTP port, group name aliases, mime types, etc. can be modified here also.

## Contents

- configuration â€“ This is the entire structure for all configuration needed by the EWS Server.

        configuration =
        {
            logAppenders
            {
                -- content removed for clarity
            },
            applications =
            {
                -- content removed for clarity
            }
        }

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| logAppenders | object | yes | Will hold a collection of log appenders. Each log message will be sent to each of the log appenders enumerated in this configuration section. |
| applications | object | yes | Will hold a collection of loaded applications. Besides that, it will also hold some other values. |

When the web server starts, the following sequence of operations is performed:

- The `logAppenders` value is read. This is where all log appenders are configured and brought up to running state. Depending on the collection of your log appenders, you may (not) see further log messages.
- The `applications` valueis taken into consideration. After this stage completes, all the applications are fully functional and the server is online and ready to do stuff.

## logAppenders

    logAppenders =
    {
        {
            name="console appender",
            type="coloredConsole",
            level=6
        },
        {
            name="file appender",
            type="file",
            level=6,
            fileName="../logs/evo-webserver",
            newLineCharacters="\n",
            fileHistorySize=100,
            fileLength=1024*1024,
            singleLine=true,
        }
    }

This section contains a list of log appenders. The entire collection of appenders listed in this section is loaded inside the logger at config-time. All log messages will be than passed to all these log appenders. Depending on the log level, an appender may (or may not) log the message. "Logging" a message means "saving" it on the specified "media" (in the example below we have a console appender and a file).

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | yes | The name of the appender. It is usually used inside pretty print routines. |
| type | string | yes | The type of the appender. It can be "console", "coloredConsole" or "file". Types "console" and "coloredConsole" will output to the console. The difference between them is that "coloredConsole" will also apply a color to the message, depending on the log level. Quite useful when eye-balling the console. Type "file" log appender will output everything to the specified file. |
| level | number | yes | The log level used. The values are presented just below. Any message having a log level less or equal to this value will be logged. The rest are discarded. (**Log levels:** 0 FATAL, 1 ERROR, 2 WARNING, 3 INFO, 4 DEBUG, 5 FINE, 6 FINEST, -1 disable logs) |
| fileName | string | yes | If the type of appender is a file, this will contain the path of the file. |
| newLineCharacters | string | no | Newline character used in the file appender. |
| fileHistorySize | number | no | The maximum number of log files to be retained. The oldest log file will be deleted first if this number is exceeded. |
| fileLength | number | no | Buffer size of the file appender. |
| singleLine | boolean | no | If yes, multi-line log messages are merged into one line. |

## applications

    applications =
    {
        rootDirectory = "./",
        {
            name="webserver",
            -- settings for application
            -- content removed for clarity
        }
    }

This section is where all the applications inside the server are placed. It holds the attributes of each application that the server will use to launch them. Each application may have specific attributes that it requires to execute its own functionality.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rootDirectory | string | True | The folder containing applications subfolders. If this path begins with a "/" or "\" (depending on the OS), then is treated as an absolute path. Otherwise is treated as a path relative to the run-time directory (the place where you started the server). |

Following the rootDirectory, there is webserver application. This application has its properties contained in an object. See details below.

## webServer Application

This is where the settings of the webserver application are defined.

    applications=
    {
        rootDirectory="./",

            mimeType="video/mp4",
            streamType="",
            isManifest=false,
        },

## apiProxy

Proxy authentication provides a way to secure the HTTP based EMS API. All API commands will first pass through the EWS, which will validate the provided username and password, and then pass the commands to the EMS for processing. API command return values will be routed back to the caller appropriately.

    apiProxy=
    {
        authentication="basic", -- none, basic
        pseudoDomain="<domain>",
        address="127.0.0.1",
        port=7777,
        userName="<username>",
        password="<password>",
        }users=
        {
            user1="password1",
            user2="password2",
        }
        realms=
        {
            {
                name="EVOSTREAM stream router",
                method="Digest",
                users={
                "user1",
                "user2",
            },
        },
    }

To enable Proxy Authentication you will open the _webconfig.lua_ config file and uncomment the "apiProxy" section near the bottom of the file.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| authentication | object | yes | The type of authentication. Currently, there are only 2 available values: "basic" which is basic HTTP authentication that uses a username and password; and "none" which disables authentication. |
| pseudoDomain | object | yes | The domain name or folder |
| address | number | yes | The address using the inboundHTTPJsonCLI |
| port | number | yes | Port, referring to the config.lua's acceptors for inboundHTTPJsonCLI |
| userName | string | No | Basic authentication username |
| password | string | No | Password for the userName |

Once enabled, new API calls using Proxy Authentication will be formatted as follows:

    http://userName:password@IPofEWS:port/pseudoDomain/command?params=â€¦

## pushPullSetup.xml

This file is used when reconnecting to the stream after restarting the EMS server and is automatically updated when a stream is created or deleted. If the file does not exist (or when it's deleted), it will be generated automatically by EMS.

## users.lua (Authentication)

users.lua contains the user names and passwords to be used in authentication.

    users=
    {
        user1="password1",
        user2="password2",
    }
    realms=

## pushPullSetup.xml

This file is used when reconnecting to the stream after restarting the EMS server and is automatically updated when a stream is created or deleted. If the file does not exist (or when it's deleted), it will be generated automatically by EMS.

## auth.xml

The configuration for the authentication. If true, the authentication declared in users.lua will be read before the streaming starts.

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <BOOL name="">true</BOOL>

## bandwidths.xml

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>

    </MAP>

If enableCheckBandwidth in config.lua is true, automatically EMS will read the bandwidths.xml file. EMS will limit all the incoming and outgoing stream dependent to the configured bandwidth range.

## blacklist.txt

The EWS can allow or disallow access to files based upon defined white lists or black lists. If a blacklist is specified, access will only be granted to an IP if that IP address does **not** appear on the blacklist.

**Note:**

- `enableIPFilter`  should be set to `true` to be able to read the blacklist file.

- `blacklistFile` should not be commented to be able to honor the list of blacklisted IP address

- If IP address is both on whitelist and blacklist file, EMS will treat the IP address as blacklisted

        enableIPFilter=true,
        whitelistFile="..\\config\\whitelist.txt",
        blacklistFile="..\\config\\blacklist.txt",

## whitelist.txt

The EWS can allow or disallow access to files based upon defined white lists or black lists. If a whitelist is specified, access will only be granted when the HTTP request originates from an IP on the whitelist.

**Note:**

- `enableIPFilter`  should be set to `true` to be able to read the whitelist file.
  
- `whitelistFile` should not be commented to be able to honor the list of blacklisted IP address
  
- If IP address is both on whitelist and blacklist file, EMS will treat the IP address as blacklisted
  
        enableIPFilter=true,
        whitelistFile="..\\config\\whitelist.txt",
