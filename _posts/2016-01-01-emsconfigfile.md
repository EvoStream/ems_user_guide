The EMS configuration file, config.lua, is a hierarchical data structure of assignments (key names with values). It is sent as a parameter when running the EvoStream server. The format is as follows:

`<keyname>= <value>`
where `<value>` could be any of the following types:

- string = series of alpha numeric characters enclosed in double quotes
- number = digits (without double quotes around it)
- array = list of values separated by comma and is grouped by braces {}
- aliases = {"flvplayback1", "vod1", "live"}

Example:

object = list of assignments enclosed by braces {}

    configurations =
    {
        daemon = "true",
        pathSeparator = "/",
        logAppenders = {...},
        applications = {...}
    }

Example:

In the example above, configurations has a value of type object. An object is a group of data inside braces (`{ }`) which may contains several assignments (`<keynames> = <values>`) separated by commas (`,`) and in turn could be another object. The assignments in the example above are daemon, pathSeparator, logAppenders, and applications. Notice that the values of logAppenders and applications could be another object or array recursively.

    configuration = { daemon = false, pathSeparator = "/", logAppenders = {_-- content removed for clarity_ }, applications = {_-- content removed for clarity_ }}}Contents

**configuration** – This is the entire structure for all configuration needed by the EMS Server.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| daemon | boolean | yes | **true**  means the server will start in daemon mode. **false** means it will start in console mode (nice for development). |
| pathSeparator | string(1) | yes | This value will be used by the server to compose paths (like media files paths). Examples: on UNIX-like systems this is / while on windows is \. Special care must be taken when you specify this value on windows because \ is an escape sequence for Lua so the value should be "\\". |
| logAppenders | object | yes | Will hold a collection of log appenders. Each log message will be sent to each of the log appenders enumerated in this configuration section. |
| eventLogger | object | No | Settings for the server-wide event sinks |
| applications | object | yes | Will hold a collection of loaded applications. Besides that, it will also hold few other values. |
| instancesCount | number | yes | The number of virtual instances of EMS server where load balancing will be performed. If this item is missing, it will be replaced by 0, disabling multiple instances. If its value is -1, it will be replaced by the number of CPUs, enabling one or more additional instances. |
| clientSideBuffer | Number | No | The number of seconds that the EMS will buffer when behaving as an RTMP client. |
| maxRtmpOutBuffer | Number | No | The maximum amount of bytes the EMS will store in the output RTMP buffer |
| maxRTSPOutBuffer | Number | No | The maximum amount of bytes the EMS will store in the output RTSP buffer. Only used for RTSP when the final transport is RTP over TCP |

When the server starts, the following sequence of operations is performed:

The configuration file is loaded. Part of the loading process, is the verification,. If if something is wrong with the syntax, please try this:

- For Linux Package:

        /usr/bin/evostreamms –use-implicit-console-appender /etc/evostreamms/config.lua

- For Linux Archive:

        cd EMS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
        ./evostreamms --use-implicit-console-appender ../config/config.lua

- For Windows:

        cd EMS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
        evostreamms --use-implicit-console-appender config\config.lua

**Note:** EMS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY is the `bin` directory within the EvoStream Media Server Archive directory.

  1. The "daemon" value is read. The server now will either fork to become daemon or continue as is in console mode.
  2. The "logAppenders" value is read. This is where all log appenders are configured and brought up to running state. Depending on the collection of your log appenders, you may (not) see further log messages.
  3. The "applications" value is taken into consideration. Up until now, the server doesn't do much. After this stage completes, all the applications are fully functional and the server is online and ready to do stuff.

## logAppenders

    logAppenders =
    {
        {
            name="console appender",
            type="coloredConsole",
            level=6
        },
        {
            name="file appender",
            type="file",
            level=6,
            fileName="../logs/evostream",
        }
    }

This section contains a list of log appenders. The entire collection of appenders listed in this section is loaded inside the logger at config-time. All log messages will be than passed to all these log appenders. Depending on the log level, an appender may (or may not) log the message. "Logging" a message means "saving" it on the specified "media" (in the example below we have a console appender and a file).

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | yes | The name of the appender. It is usually used inside pretty print routines. |
| type | string | yes | The type of the appender. Types `console` and `coloredConsole` will output to the console. The difference between them is that `coloredConsole` will also apply a color to the message, depending on the log level. Quite useful when eye-balling the console. Type `file` log appender will output everything to the specified file. |
| level | number | yes | The log level used. The values are presented just below. Any message having a log level less or equal to this value will be logged. The rest are discarded. (**Log levels:** 0 FATAL, 1 ERROR, 2 WARNING, 3 INFO, 4 DEBUG, 5 FINE, 6 FINEST, -1 disable logs) |
| fileName | string | yes | If the type of appender is a file, this will contain the path of the file. |
| newLineCharacters | string | no | Newline character used in the file appender. |
| fileHistorySize | number | no | The maximum number of log files to be retained. The oldest log file will be deleted first if this number is exceeded. |
| fileLength | number | no | Buffer size of the file appender. |
| singleLine | boolean | no | If yes, multi-line log messages are merged into one line. |

    logAppenders =
    {
        {
            name="console appender",
            type="coloredConsole",
            level=6
        },
        {
            name="file appender",
            type="file",
            level=6,
            fileName="../logs/evostream",
        }
    }

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | yes | The name of the appender. It is usually used inside pretty print routines. |
| type | string | yes | The type of the appender. Types `console` and `coloredConsole` will output to the console. The difference between them is that `coloredConsole` will also apply a color to the message, depending on the log level. Quite useful when eye-balling the console. Type `file` log appender will output everything to the specified file. |
| level | number | yes | The log level used. The values are presented just below. Any message having a log level less or equal to this value will be logged. The rest are discarded. (**Log levels:** 0 FATAL, 1 ERROR, 2 WARNING, 3 INFO, 4 DEBUG, 5 FINE, 6 FINEST, -1 disable logs) |
| fileName | string | yes | If the type of appender is a file, this will contain the path of the file. |
| newLineCharacters | string | no | Newline character used in the file appender. |
| fileHistorySize | number | no | The maximum number of log files to be retained. The oldest log file will be deleted first if this number is exceeded. |
| fileLength | number | no | Buffer size of the file appender. |
| singleLine | boolean | no | If yes, multi-line log messages are merged into one line. |

**Note:** When daemon mode is set to true, all console appenders will be ignored. (Read the explanation for daemon setting above).

## applications

    applications =
    {
        rootDirectory = "./",
        {
            name="evostreamms",
            -- settings for evostreamms
        },
        {
            name="anotherApplication",
            -- settings for anotherApplication
        },
    }

This section is where all the applications inside the server are placed. It holds the attributes of each application that the server will use to launch them. Each application may have specific attributes that it requires to execute its own functionality.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rootDirectory | string | true | The folder containing applications subfolders. If this path begins with a "/" or "\" (depending on the OS), then is treated as an absolute path. Otherwise is treated as a path relative to the run-time directory (the place where you started the server). |

## media

This is where the settings of media folder defined. There are several uses of the media folder:

- Storage of vod file that is used for pullStream

        {mediaStorage = { recordedStreamsStorage="../media", { description="Default media storage", mediaFolder="../media", },

Location of the created file using generateLazyPull command
- Storage of recorded streams using record command

## acceptors

The "acceptors" block is found within the "applications" section named "evostreamms" in the configuration file. Each acceptor protocol used by applications is defined here. Some protocols may require additional parameters.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ip | string | yes | The IP where the service is located. A value of 0.0.0.0 means all interfaces and all IPs. |

## autoHLS/HDS/DASH/MSS

Within the "evostreamms" application section of the config.lua file, you will need to uncomment out the autoHLS group. (To uncomment it remove the "--[[" and "]]--" strings).

    autoDASH=
    
        targetFolder= "..\\evo-webroot",
    },
    autoHLS=
    {
        targetFolder= "..\\evo-webroot",
    },
    autoHDS=
    {
        targetFolder= "..\\evo-webroot",
    },
    autoMSS=
    {
        targetFolder= "..\\evo-webroot",
    },

The autoHLS/HDS/DASH/MSS configuration group defines the parameter settings that will be used when the createHLS/HDS/DASH/MSSStream is automatically called on stream creation. Since targetFolder is the only mandatory field in create stream, that value MUST be specified in the autoHLS section. All other parameters can be specified if you want to override the default values.

## authentication

The "authentication" block is found within the "applications" section named "evostreamms" in the configuration file. Authentication settings for RTMP and RTSP protocols are defined separately. For RTMP, another file, `auth.xml`, is required to enable authentication. In addition, a users file, typically named `users.lua`, provides the user names and passwords.

| Protocol | Parameter | Mandatory | Typical Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RTMP | type | true | "adobe" |
|   | encoderAgents | true | "FMLE…" _(see below)_ |
|   | usersFile | true | "../config/users.lua" |
| RTSP | usersFile | true | "../config/users.lua" |
|   | authenticatePlay | false | true (default value is false) |

    authentication=
    {
        rtmp=
        {
            type="adobe",
            encoderAgents=
            {
                "FMLE/3.0 (compatible; FMSc/1.0)",
                "Wirecast/FM 1.0 (compatible; FMSc/1.0)",
                "EvoStream Media Server (www.evostream.com)"
            },
            usersFile="..\\config\\users.lua"
        },
        rtsp=
        {
            usersFile="..\\config\\users.lua",
            --authenticatePlay=false,
        }
    },

**Note:**

Authentication is disabled if the "authentication" block in the "config.lua" file is missing or incomplete. For RTMP protocol, authentication is disabled if the "auth.xml" file is missing or contains a "false" setting. For RTSP protocol, authentication is disabled if "authenticatePlay" in the "rtsp" block is omitted or set to "false".

## eventLogger

To enable Event Notifications you will need to enable/uncomment the eventLogger section of the config.lua file. Comments in LUA are specified by either a "--" for a single line, or denoted by a "--[[" to start a comment block and a "]]--" to end a comment block. By default the eventLogger section is commented out using the block style comments, so you will need to remove both the --[[and]]--strings.

The configuration entry must be constructed as follows:

    eventLogger=
    {
        sinks=
        {
            type="sink1_type",
            -- property1 of sink1
            -- property2 of sink1
        },
        enabledEvents=
        {
            "inStreamCreated",
            "inStreamClosed",
        }
    },

The `enabledEvents` parameter is optional and allows you to specify only the events which you wish to receive. If the enabledEvents section is not specified, all events will be generated.

All event types are listed below.

## Event Sinks

There are two main types of event sinks:

1\. **File Event Sink** – Event details are written to a log file located relative to the current directory. The log file is overwritten each time the EMS starts up.

        type="file",
        filename="log.txt",
        format="text",
        customData="my custom data"

File sink configuration:

The format can be one of the following types:

- "text" (plain text)
- "xml"
- "json"
- "w3c"

        eventLogger=
        {
            sinks=
            {
                {
                    type="file",
                    filename="../logs/events.txt",
                    --format="text",
                    --format="xml",
                    --format="json",

                    fileChunkTime="18:00:00",
                    enabledEvents=
                    {
                        "inStreamCreated",
                        "outStreamCreated",
                        "streamCreated",
                        -- content removed for clarity
                    },
                    {
                        -- content removed for clarity
                    },
                },
            },
        },

A typical configuration of a file sink follows:

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| customData | object | no | Custom data that will be appended to all events generated by this sink. It overrides the custom data node defined on the upper level. It can also be a complex structure, see illustration above. |
| type | string | yes | The type of sink, "file". |
| filename | string | yes | The base name of the file. |
| format | string | yes | Sets the file format. Allowed values are "text", "xml", "json" and "w3c" |
| timestamp | boolean | no |  |
| appendTimestamp | boolean | no | Sets the option to append a timestamp. If true, timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHmmSS) is appended on every log file created. Otherwise, a 4-digit running number is appended. Default value is true. |
| appendInstance | boolean | no | Appends a random 4-digit instance ID after every log file. Default is false. |
| fileChunkLength | number | no | Number of seconds to create new file. |
| fileChunkTime | string | no | Time of the day to chunk log file, in HH:MM:SS format. _Note__: No file chunking when fileChunkLength and fileChunkTime are both present._ |
| enabledEvents | object | no | Events that are logged. If not set, all are logged. But for W3C, non-stream-related events are ignored. |

As indicated above, the name of the file can be set using a number of options. For example,

    filename = "/var/evostreamms/logs/streams"
    appendTimestamp = true
    appendInstance = true

The log file would be `/var/evostreamms/logs/streams_0237_20140311_183046.txt`.


2\. **RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) Event Sink** – Event details are transmitted to a remote host via HTTP POST. The EMS will ignore any response from the remote host.

RPC sink configuration:

    type="RPC",
    url="http://192.168.1.5:5555/something/service",
    serializerType="JSON",
    customData="my custom data"

The `url` field specifies the destination which will be accepting the HTTP POST event notifications..

The `serializer` type can be one of the following formats:

- **JSON**

Format of JSON POST:

        {"payload":{"creationTimestamp":1349335053486.4370,"name":"","queryTimestamp":1349335053487.4370,"type":"NR","uniqueId":1,"upTime":1.0000},"type":"streamCreated"}

- **XML**

Format of XML POST:

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <MAP isArray="false" name="">
        <MAP isArray="false" name="payload">
            <DOUBLE name="creationTimestamp">1349335287346.813</DOUBLE>
            <STR name="name"></STR>
            <DOUBLE name="queryTimestamp">1349335287346.813</DOUBLE>
            <STR name="type">NR</STR>
            <UINT64 name="uniqueId">1</UINT64>
            <DOUBLE name="upTime">0.000</DOUBLE>
        </MAP>
    <STR name="type">streamCreated</STR>
    </MAP>

- **XMLRPC**

Format of XMLRPC POST: (indented for clarity)

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <methodCall>
        <methodName>event.Log</methodName>
        <params>
            <param>
                <value>
                    <struct>
                        <member>
                            <name>payload</name>
                            <value>
                                <struct>
                                <member>
                                    <name>creationTimestamp</name>
                                    <value><double>0.000000</double></value>
                                </member>
                                <!-- contents removed for clarity -->
                                </struct>
                            </value>
                        </member>
                        <member>
                            <name>type</name>
                            <value><string>streamCreated</string></value>
                        </member>
                    </struct>
                </value>
            </param>
        </params>
    </methodCall>

The `customData` parameter for both File and RPC Event Sinks can be _optionally_ used to extra data to each event for that sink. This could be used to identify the particular EMS instance which is generating the event, return a particular ID or Key which is pertinent to your handling of the event, or anything really! A customData parameter can be a simple sting value or a complex LUA object.

If a `customData` parameter is not specified for a node, the value of the parent eventLogger customData node will be used. If that is also not specified, the value will be V_NULL.

## Transcoder

Within the application section you can find the configuration for the EvoStream Transcoder. The default settings are generally going to be fine for all applications, but under certain circumstances they may need to be adjusted. The transcoder section looks like the following:

    transcoder = {
        scriptPath="..\\emsTranscoder.bat",
        srcUriPrefix="rtsp://localhost:5544/",
        dstUriPrefix="-f flv tcp://localhost:6666/"
    },

The `srcUriPrefix` tells the transcoder how to get the stream from the EMS. The `dstUriPrefix` tells the transcoder how to push the stream back to the EMS. The ports used in these two values must match the acceptors the EMS is actively listening on. By default this is i`5544` for RTSP and `6666` for liveFLV.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scriptPath | string | yes | The location for the helper script for the transcoder. The transcode API function calls this script instead of calling the binary directly so that the binary can be replaced should you want to use a custom transcoder. |
| srcUriPrefix | String | Yes | When using the transcode API function, you can specify just a localStreamName as the source stream. This is the prefix that will be pre-pended to the provided localStreamName when actually pulling that source stream. For example, if `srcUriPrefix="rtsp://localhost:5544"` and the stream name `"test1"` is given to the transcode command, the following URI will be used: `rtsp://localhost:5544/test1` |
| dstUriPrefix | String | Yes | This is the converse of the srcUriPrefix, in that if just a localStreamName is given as a destination in the transcode command, this is the string that will be prepended to the stream name. That complete command will then be used by the transcoder to send the stream back to the EMS. |

## drm

Also in the application section of the config.lua file, the DRM section provides the configuration values for any DRM that needs to be activated. This section is commented out by default (wrapped in "--[[" and "]]--"). It must be un-commented-out before DRM will be activated.

    drm={
        type="verimatrix",
        requestTimer=1,
        reserveKeys=10,
        reserveIds=10,
        -- urlPrefix="http://server1.evostream1.com:12684/CAB/keyfile"
        urlPrefix="http://vcas3multicas1.verimatrix.com:12684/CAB/keyfile"
    },

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | string | yes | The type of DRM to be used. Options are: "verimatrix" – Enables Verimatrix DRM on HLS "evo" – Enables AES encryption on HLS"none" – disables DRM. This is the same as commenting out this section of the config file. |
| requestTimer | Number | Yes, when type=verimatrix | The key request timer period in seconds. Right after startup, the EMS will request keys from the Verimatrix Key Server every timer period.Default=1, Min=1, Max=none. (If set below min, the min value will be used.) |
| reserveKeys | Number | Yes, when type=verimatrix | The number of keys buffered per ID.Default=10, Min=5, Max=none. (If set below min, the min value will be used.) |
| reserveIds | Number | Yes, when type=verimatrix | The number of reserve IDs with key buffers to be filled in addition to active IDs.Default=10, Min=5, Max=none. (If set below min, the min value will be used.) |
| urlPrefix |   | Yes, when type=verimatrix | The location of your Verimatrix VCAS Key Server |
